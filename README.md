The Mini User Management System is a full-stack web application designed to handle basic user authentication and role-based access.
It allows users to sign up, log in, and securely access the system, while admins can manage users efficiently.

This project demonstrates backend API development, frontend integration, JWT-based authentication, and MongoDB database usage, following real-world development practices.
